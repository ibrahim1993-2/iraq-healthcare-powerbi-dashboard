Iraq Healthcare Infrastructure Trends (1960–2024) – Power BI Dashboard
📊 Project Overview

This project analyzes Iraq’s healthcare infrastructure from 1960 to 2024 using publicly available datasets from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank.
The dashboard visualizes long-term trends in:

    Hospital beds per 1,000 people

    Physicians per 1,000 people

    Population growth

    Year-over-Year (YoY) changes

The goal is to provide a data-driven view of healthcare capacity and how it has evolved alongside Iraq’s population growth.
🛠 Tools & Technologies

    Power BI Desktop – Data modeling, DAX measures, and interactive dashboard creation.

    Power Query – Data cleaning, transformation, and shaping.

    DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Calculated measures with error handling (returning 0 or "No data" instead of blanks).

    Excel 2016 – Initial dataset review and formatting.

📈 Insights from the Data

    Physician availability saw notable fluctuations, with peaks and declines tied to political and economic events.

    Hospital bed capacity did not keep pace with population growth, indicating possible strain on healthcare services.

    Significant YoY changes highlight key turning points in healthcare investment and policy shifts.
